# CodeSniffer 3000 üê∂üíª

**CodeSniffer 3000** is a playful yet powerful tool that analyzes code and gives you a percentage score indicating how likely it is that the code was generated by AI. Think of it as your trusty sniffer dog for hunting down those sneaky AI-generated lines of code!

## Features

- **Formatting Consistency Check**: Sniffs out uniform indentation and formatting that could suggest AI involvement.
- **Generic Variable Names Check**: Detects those boring, generic variable names that AI loves to use.
- **Lack of Comments Check**: Identifies if your code is suspiciously silent with no comments‚ÄîAI might be to blame!
- **Repetitive Patterns Check**: Analyzes the code for repeated lines or structures, a hallmark of AI-generated output.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/codesniffer-3000.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
   This will open the web interface where you can paste your code and have CodeSniffer 3000 analyze it.

3. **Analyze Your Code:**
   Paste your code into the input box, click "Analyze Code," and let CodeSniffer 3000 give you a sniff of how likely it is AI-generated, in percentage form!
